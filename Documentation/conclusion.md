The optimizable ensemble outperforms individual models, providing more accurate and reliable classification by integrating diverse algorithms. Techniques like forward sequential selection and MRMR enhance model precision by focusing on the most relevant features and reducing redundancy.

The ensembleâ€™s ability to adjust through hyperparameter tuning and optimized loss functions allows it to effectively handle complex, non-linear relationships. At least 8 features are needed for effective training to maintain high accuracy.
