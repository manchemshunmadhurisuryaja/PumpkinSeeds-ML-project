Accurate classification of pumpkin seeds is essential for optimizing agricultural practices and crop management. This study shows that classification can be improved using ensemble classifiers (Bagged Trees, Boosted Trees, RUS Boosted Trees, and Optimizable Ensembles) in conjunction with the MRMR (Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance) feature extraction technique.

Previous models like Logistic Regression (87.06%), SVM (88%), Random Forest (88.2%), KNN (87%), Decision Tree (87%), and Naive Bayes (86%) laid the groundwork. Ensemble classifiers capture complex morphological features better, improving accuracy and precision. The project focuses on classifying "Ürgüp Sivrisi" and "Çerçevelik" seed varieties using advanced models and feature selection to support precision agriculture.
